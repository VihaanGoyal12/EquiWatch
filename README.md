# EquiWatch

> **Detect. Explain. Act.**  
> *An AI-powered workplace gender-equity decision-support watchdog.*

EquiWatch is a full-stack, production-grade SaaS analytics application that analyzes organizational workforce data (tasks, hours, roles, seniority, compensation, and promotions) to identify potential gender-equity disparities, explain longitudinal patterns using grounded statistical methods, and provide HR teams with actionable investigation roadmaps.

EquiWatch is strictly a **decision-support system**, not an autonomous judge. It detects potential disparities for human review without asserting guilt, illegal conduct, or intentional discrimination.

## 🌟 Key Features

1. **Workplace Equity Overview**: Real-time status across all departments with a prioritized **"Where Should HR Look First?"** review queue.
2. **Comparable-Group Fairness Checks**: Controls for role title, seniority tier, department, and tenure to demonstrate that not every raw difference is a structural disparity (e.g., explaining why raw salary gaps disappear when controlling for seniority).
3. **Four Core Analytical Pillars**:
   - **Workload**: Average hours, overtime distribution, and Mann-Whitney U tests.
   - **Task Allocation**: Categorized into 7 areas (*administrative, coordination, operational, technical, strategic, client-facing, leadership*), identifying non-promotable work burdens.
   - **Pay & Compensation**: Raw median vs comparable-group controlled pay gaps, bonus allocations, and merit increment percentages.
   - **Promotions & Velocity**: Multi-quarter advancement rates, widening gap trajectory detection, and average tenure in band before promotion.
4. **"What Should HR Do?" Action Experience**: Instant drawer generating evidence dossiers, customized leadership 1-on-1 discussion scripts, data audit checklists, and threshold explanations.
5. **"Explain This Trend" AI Chart Interpretation**: Ingests verified underlying numbers (not screenshots) to provide contextual observations and key caveats.
6. **Conversational AI Analyst**: Side panel assistant that answers complex HR inquiries while citing verified metric badges and sources.
7. **Executive Review Dossier Generator**: One-click department and company-wide report generator with printable/PDF export styling.
8. **Validated CSV Ingestion & Data Management**: Drag-and-drop CSV importer with strict schema validation, type checking, and deduplication.
9. **Empirical Precision/Recall Harness**: Honest validation benchmark measuring actual precision and recall on synthetic control cases without fabricated numbers.
10. **Government Sector Monitor (Future Scope Concept)**: Anonymized, aggregated cross-industry oversight with zero employee PII leakage.

## 🎭 The NovaWorks Demo Story Walkthrough

The seeded synthetic dataset models **NovaWorks Technologies** (1,200+ employees, 5 departments, 8 longitudinal quarters):

1. **Login as HR Lead** (`hr@novaworks.com`).
2. **Dashboard Overview**: Notice the top alert: *"4 potential equity signals require review"*.
3. **Inspect Priority Queue**: The **"Where should HR look first?"** queue flags **Sales** for persistent task allocation and promotion disparities.
4. **Open Sales Deep-Dive**:
   - **Task Allocation**: See that women carry **61% of administrative tasks** vs **39% for men** (a 22.0 pp difference).
   - **Promotions**: View the 8-quarter trajectory where female promotion rates (**18.4%**) lag male rates (**26.7%**) by **8.3 pp**, with the gap widening over time.
   - **Explain with AI**: Click *"Explain this trend"* to see structured natural-language observations.
5. **Compare with Finance**:
   - Open **Finance** to observe an apparent raw pay difference that **disappears completely** when controlling for role title and seniority bands (99.2% parity within comparable tiers).
6. **Trigger Decision Actions**:
   - On the Sales signal, click **"What should HR do?"** to generate customized leadership 1-on-1 discussion scripts and investigation checklists.
7. **Generate Report**:
   - Click **"Generate Department Report"** to produce an official printable review dossier.
8. **Test Empirical Accuracy**:
   - Visit `/impact` to review the live **Empirical Precision & Recall Benchmark Harness** run directly against 100 control test cases.

## 📐 Mathematical & Statistical Methodology

EquiWatch separates statistical computation from narrative generation. Every metric, delta, and p-value is computed deterministically by the Python analytics engine using standard statistical tests.

### 1. Composite Equity Health Index (0–100 Score)

```text
Equity Index = 100 - [ (0.30 × Pay_Penalty) + (0.30 × Promo_Penalty) + (0.25 × Task_Penalty) + (0.15 × Workload_Penalty) ]
```
* **Pay Penalty**: `Controlled Pay Gap (%) × 4.0`
* **Promotion Penalty**: `(Annualized Promotion Gap pp × 2.5) + (Velocity Delay Months × 1.5)`
* **Task Penalty**: `Largest Task Category Gap (pp) × 1.5`
* **Workload Penalty**: `Absolute Average Quarterly Hours Difference × 2.0`

---

### 2. Task Allocation ("Office Housework" & Visibility)

* **Category Share Percentage**:
  ```text
  Female Share (%) = (Total Female Hours in Category / Total Female Department Hours) × 100
  Male Share (%)   = (Total Male Hours in Category / Total Male Department Hours) × 100
  Difference (pp)  = Female Share (%) - Male Share (%)
  ```
* **Two-Way Chi-Square Test ($\chi^2$)**:
  ```text
  Chi-Square (χ²) = Sum [ (Observed_Hours - Expected_Hours)² / Expected_Hours ]
  Expected Hours  = (Total Gender Hours × Total Category Hours) / Total Department Hours
  ```
  *Evaluates whether task distributions across genders differ due to systematic allocation ($p < 0.05$).*

---

### 3. Compensation Parity (Raw vs. Controlled Gap)

* **Raw Median Pay Gap (Unadjusted)**:
  ```text
  Raw Pay Gap (%) = [ (Female Median Salary - Male Median Salary) / Male Median Salary ] × 100
  ```
* **Controlled / Adjusted Pay Gap (Cohort-Weighted)**:
  To eliminate **Simpson's Paradox** (where differences in seniority distort aggregate pay), gaps are controlled within identical `(Role + Seniority Level)` cohorts:
  ```text
  Cohort_Gap (%) = [ (Female Median - Male Median) / Male Median ] × 100
  Cohort_Weight  = Female Count + Male Count

  Controlled Gap (%) = Sum of (Cohort_Gap × Cohort_Weight) / Total Employees
  ```
* **Statistical Test (Mann-Whitney U)**: Non-parametric rank-sum test evaluating whether salary distributions differ without distortion from high-earner outliers.

---

### 4. Promotion Velocity & Career Progression

* **Annualized Promotion Rate**:
  ```text
  Promotion Rate (%) = (Total Promotions in past 4 Quarters / Eligible Employees in Level) × 100
  Rate Gap (pp)       = Female Promotion Rate (%) - Male Promotion Rate (%)
  ```
* **Average Tenure-in-Band (Promotion Velocity)**:
  ```text
  Average Tenure (Months) = Sum of (Promotion Date - Role Start Date) / Total Promotions
  Velocity Gap (Months)   = Female Average Tenure - Male Average Tenure
  ```
* **Two-Proportion Z-Test**: Computes $Z$-score and $p$-value for difference in promotion probabilities across comparable cohorts.

---

### 5. Workload & Overtime Distribution

* **Quarterly Hours Delta**: `Average Female Hours - Average Male Hours`
* **Overtime Rate (Threshold > 520h/quarter)**: `[ Count(Hours > 520h) / Cohort Headcount ] × 100`
* **Welch's Two-Sample t-Test**:
  ```text
  t = (Female Mean Hours - Male Mean Hours) / sqrt[ (Female Variance / N_Female) + (Male Variance / N_Male) ]
  ```

## 📜 Ethical Principles & Limitations

- **No Autonomous Decisions**: EquiWatch does not determine that discrimination has occurred.
- **Minimum Sample Safeguards**: Requires a minimum cohort sample ($n \ge 8$) before raising signals.
- **Privacy by Design**: Role-gated views prevent PII exposure to external monitors.
